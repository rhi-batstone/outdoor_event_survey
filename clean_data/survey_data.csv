Maybe we could have split the cars (eg by race number, car reg....), with a fixed number turning right off the A9 northbound at Dunkeld, some turning left from A9 southbound onto the old A9 at Dowally, some turning left off A9 northbound at Luncarty through Stanley........  ?",Average,NA,Not interested in social programme,NA,"I run M55S as I'm not particularly fit - I'd run M55L if I was fitter  (I assume most M55S would say the same).

There needs to be proper recognition of the difference between campervans and motorhomes; a rough rule of thumb is a big white vehicle is a motorhome and smaller ones which are non white are campervans. In general motorhomes are heavy and poor in damp fields so are best on hard standing whereas camperw=vans are like large cars such as the big BMW estates. Early arrivals at parking should be near to assembly as they have to go to the starts first; day 5 was the opposite.
